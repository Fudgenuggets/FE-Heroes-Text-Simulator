# FE-Heroes-Text-Simulator



**Be sure to download and install the font file included so that the font displays correctly.**


**Does NOT include character portraits. You will have to download them elsewhere.**



Simulates conversation using the assets from Fire Emblem Heroes. Includes text boxes, font, and ability to resize character portraits and background so that it matches how it would appear in the actual game.


Saved images are 720 x 1280 pixels. If you are using custom character portraits, they work best if they are 1684 x 1920 pixels—the same size at the official character portraits in the game.



It is not 100% accurate to how it would appear in the game, but I tried to make it close to how it would be.
